       <h2 class="Title">Income by County</h2>
          <p class="">This visualization shows each county with four different incomes - income with food stamps, income per capita, mean family income, and median family income. Per capita income is the average income earned per person in a given area and calculated by the area's total income by its total population.  While the mean family income is the average income within the county.  The median is the middle household income of the county. <br><br> By far, Johnson County, has less people on food stamps and a higher mean family income than either Jackson or Wyandotte Counties. </p>

       <h2 class="Title">Ratio of Income to Poverty Level Within The Kansas City Area</h2>
          <p class="">This visualization shows each county where their citizens sit on the poverty thresold.  According to census.gov, where this information was obtained, "the total family income divided by the poverty threshold is called Ratio of Income to Poverty. The poverty threshold is the dollar amounts used to determine poverty status and vary by size of family and age of the members."[1]  It is also called the poverty line or the minimum level of income to live in a country. You divide income by the threshold and it equals the different sections on the chart.  <br><br> 
              According to this graph, the higher the number (2.0), the more means a family has to take care of themselves.  For example if a family of 4 makes 40,000/yr and the thresold for a family of 4 is 26,200; they fall in the 1.5 category, almost 1.5 times the poverty line. Everyone in the GREEN is below the poverty line.  Again, Johnson County, has the most in the 2.0 category, while Jackson County has the most in poverty. <br><br>

          <p class="">This visualization shows each county with three different population totals - total population within the county, total NOT enrolled in school, and total enrolled in school - same as the above graph.  However, this includes black and white demographics in each county.<br><br>It shows overall, Wyandotte is a smaller county out of the three. And white flight is stil in effect in the Kansas City area, where the highest ratio of white students are enrolled in Johnson County and the highest enrollment of black students is in Jackson County. </p>

          <p class="">This visualization shows Kansas City school districts, the number of schools each district has, the number of students and whether there was a desegregation plan for this year. Many of the schools within the Kansas City, MO city limits are a one or two school district because it is a charter school meant to "attract" white families into lower income areas of the city.</p>
