        <h2>Data Critique</h2>
 <p class="card-text">Kansas City’s Segregation Struggle is a project looking into the desegregation of Kansas City, MO school district current struggle and the history behind it.  The dataset which prompted the project is from data.gov and gathered under the Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights (OCR).  It is titled “Civil Rights Data Collection, 2013-14,” and examines education and civil rights issues within the United States’ public school systems. Different categories examined are student enrollment, disaggregated by race/ethnicity, sex, disability.  This information can help with the contextual information and could have insight into the state of civil rights in the nation, such as demographics in enrollment, advanced placement classes, discipline, and special education services.  The data is collected from all public-school districts - referred to as local education agencies (LEAs), charter schools, alternative schools, and schools serving students with disabilities.    <br><br>
Focusing on the column, “Desegregation Plan,” I noticed many of the school districts across the United States did NOT have a plan and no districts within the Kansas City area had a desegregation plan in the school year 2013-2014.  However, what is telling, is the OCR is still required to ask this because some districts DO implement plans for desegregation.  Looking into this background, it led the research team down Kansas City’s tumultuous past with segregation and left me wondering why is the city struggling so much with this issue?  <br><br>
The author used raw data from census.gov to find out the underlying economic, cultural, and demographic issues within Kansas City and the surrounding areas.  I focused on three counties in the Kansas City area – Johnson County, KS; Wyandotte County, KS; and Jackson County, MO.  Wyandotte and Jackson Counties have Kansas City, KS and Kansas City, MO within their borders.  While Johnson County has affluent suburbs of Kansas City.  These counties do not contain all the suburbs of Kansas City, Johnson County is the most affluent and largest.   <br><br>
The datasets I chose to look at are the poverty level, enrollment in school overall, enrollment in school between white and black races, school budgets, and income by county.  Each one is from the year 2013 and were downloaded separately from the Census.gov website.  The datasets given to me were raw and a lot of change went into the final data product to the visualizations seen on this website. Through these datasets, it shows the suburbs within Johnson County, KS are more affluent and children who grow up in this county have a head start in life because they were given more opportunity.  The data visuals also show Kansas City still has a “white flight” problem, which became an issue after the Civil Rights act became law and continuing on even through their federal court battles (Missouri V. Jenkins’ (1995)).
