        <h2>Introduction</h2>
 <p class="card-text">This project focuses on the Midwest, specifically Kansas City, both Missouri and Kansas, and its’ affluent suburbs, we can see the pay, economic, living gap is still present.  By looking at the different demographics of Kansas City, one can see “white flight,” a popularized saying of the desegregation process; how the city has reacted to this, i.e. court cases and influx of state funding to under privileged school districts.  Looking at Kansas City and area suburbs, the audience can see the city is an ideal place to study because the attempts to change the demographics within the city did not work and the complexity of desegregation within schools reveals to be more about social issues than about education itself.  Through visualizations, the data shows Kanas City is still a largely split city when it comes to the demographic, poverty levels and living gap.   
        <br>
                <br>
Schools are still asked if they have desegregation plans by the Department of Education, under their department – the Office for Civil Rights and put out through Data.gov in Civil Rights Data Collections (CRDC).  While the answer is overwhelmingly “no” when it comes to having a plan within the school district, this is a telling that the data set still has a column for this question when the Civil Rights Act and Brown v Board was enacted decades ago.  The data used in this project came from census.gov and were all carefully chosen, downloaded and put into visualizations by the author of this project.  <br><br>
         As a native to this area of the country, I feel Kansas City is unrepresented as a metropolitan city.  When asked about this great city, many do not know it has a rich, cultural history and a vibrant art scene today.  Although, this project sheds a light on the negative history in this great area – and as a person who inhabited this city for four years – it is still good to understand the full story, even if it is a troubled past.   </p>

   <h2>Project Charter</h2>
          <p>I came to into this course with a positive attitude and thinking I would have the ability to complete everything by myself.  This project has been by far the most aggravating, enlightening, and educational thing I have created alone.  Every week, I felt like I was behind; when I should have stepped back and just looked at the bigger picture.  I chose a difficult and tumultuous subject to traverse through these past ten weeks.  Professor O’Hara provided a plethora of dataset options to choose from.  However, none of them spoke to me on a personal level and since I was working alone, I went off board, choosing my own datasets.  This was my first roadblock because I spent far too long trying to decide on the correct dataset, when I ultimately ended up compiling my own from Census.gov raw data.  But again, this took extra weeks to figure out and put me behind schedule in the much larger project scale. <br><br> 
After downloading the proper datasets from Census.gov, I had to sift through which information was necessary for my project.  Each set took hours to manipulate on an excel sheet.  Then I used the program Tableau to create my visualizations.  I originally thought I could work with a network analysis program to create nodes of information to connect between my three counties.  However, each of my datasets did not contain enough information and the network analysis program Palladio, I felt, was not sophisticated enough.  I could not get Gephi, another network analysis program to work on my computer, and with the poor results from Palladio, I did not pursue it further. <br><br> 
When it came to the website, I have some experience because I took CSci 102 in Fall quarter 2019.  However, I kept getting caught on technical difficulties, and spending way more time worrying about appearance of the website, than the substance of it.  I know I missed something within the project details. <br><br>
Ultimately, coming into this fresh without any experience, it was difficult for me to fully appreciate the steps of the project because I kept worrying over technical problems with the website and data analysis programs.  I put more stress on myself by working alone.  I did learn more about a city I love however, which will make me look at Kansas City differently.  Final thoughts – I wish I would have teamed up with one of the other teams so I could have focused more on learning about the Digital Humanities aspect instead of focusing on technical problems 90% of the time. <br><br>
